Paynow API

Explanation for bot.py

To run the server.py use py server.py
To run the bot.py , use py bot.py


When you later deploy your bot (e.g., to Render, Railway, or Vercel),
you’ll replace the local URL (http://localhost:4242/webhook) with your public one:

https://yourdomain.com/webhook


and Stripe will send live payment data there automatically.
